Mars Photo Grabber
==================

We're on mars, yet NASA can't seem to figure out how to bundle up all these
amazing photos into a single, downloadable spot.

This scrapes, downloads and organizes the mars photos found at
http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/images/image-collection_archive_1.html

If you don't want to run the script to grab the images yourself, I have them
hosted on dropbox.
